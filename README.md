# Usage

After a new surfer logs in with a surfername, an email, and a password the surfer is presented with all log_entries. The surfer may input into a personal log entry specific data about a particular surf session they had. The data includes the surfspot, date, and discription with optional info about swell direction, swell size, weather conditions, wave count and the option to upload an image. The surfer can then view their own log entries or may select a single log entry from their own log entries or from the Surfers Log community. The surfer also has the ability to edit or delete their own log entries.
