# Surfers::Log

Surf, log, share, using a new app called Surfer's Log. Recording your surf sessions allows you to relive those epic days and to dial in a specific spot with specific conditions. Sign up today and start logging!


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'surfers-log'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install surfers-log

## Usage

After a new surfer logs in with a surfername, an email, and a password the surfer is presented with all log_entries. The surfer may input into a personal log entry specific data about a particular surf session they had. The data includes the surfspot, date, and discription with optional info about swell direction, swell size, weather conditions, wave count and the option to upload an image. The surfer can then view their own log entries or may select a single log entry from their own log entries or from the Surfers Log community. The surfer also has the ability to edit or delete their own log entries.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
