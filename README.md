# Surfers::Log

Surf, log, share, using a new app called Surfers Log. Recording your surf sessions allows you to relive those epic days and to dial in a specific spot with specific conditions. Sign up today and start logging!


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'surfers-log'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install surfers-log

## Usage

After a surfer logs in with surfername, email, and password the surfer may input into a log entry specific data about a surf session. The data includes the surfspot, date, and discription with optional info about swell direction, swell size, weather conditions, wave count and the option to upload a photo. The surfer can then view their log entries or view a list of log entries from the Surfers Log community. The surfer also has the ability to edit or delete their own log entries.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
